# My-Project-Analog-Clock
This project showcases a beautiful and functional analog clock implemented using web technologies - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
With elegant design and smooth animations, this analog clock not only tells you the current time but also serves as a testament to the power of front-end web development.
